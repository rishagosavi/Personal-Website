            This upcoming fall, I will be starting my freshman year in high school. Currently I am a little anxious about starting my classes soon and getting adjusted to the schedule. At the same time, I am excited about exploring the school, joining clubs that I find interesting, meeting new people, and making more friends. Growing up as a kid, I have constantly moved around to several places. I was born in Detroit, Michigan and from there I have moved to Oregon and North Carolina. I stayed in Charlotte, North Carolina and then my family relocated to Oregon again. Due to my dad's job, I got the opportunity to experience different regions and see the diversity in people around the US.
